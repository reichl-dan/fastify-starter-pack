## Usage

### Basic Usage

The simplest way to use the plugin:

```typescript
import fastify from 'fastify'
import fastifyCore from '@fastify/core'

async function startServer() {
  const server = fastify()
  await server.register(fastifyCore)
  await server.start()
  return server
}
```

### Configuring Plugins

All bundled plugins can be configured through an options object when registering the core plugin. Optional plugins like cors, cookie, and rate-limit are only included when their respective configurations are provided:

```typescript
await server.register(fastifyCore, {
  // Include and configure CORS
  cors: {
    origin: ['https://your-domain.com'],
    credentials: true
  },
  // Include and configure cookie parsing
  cookie: {
    secret: "my-secret",
    parseOptions: {}
  },
  // Include and configure rate limiting
  rateLimit: {
    max: 100,
    timeWindow: '1 minute'
  },
  // Configure custom health check response
  healthCheck: {
    status: 'ok',
    version: '1.0.0'
  }
})
```

The server will use default configurations for required plugins if no options are provided. Optional plugins are only included when their configuration is specified in the options object.
